# ðŸ¦– Reactosaurus

Welcome to **Reactosaurus**, the prehistoric React project that roars louder than a T-Rex on a sugar rush! ðŸ¦•ðŸ¦–

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

Reactosaurus is a fun-filled learning project that demonstrates the power of React with the attitude of a dinosaur.

## ðŸŽ‰ Fun Facts

- This project was built in the **Paleozoic Era** (aka last weekend).
- It's rumored that this project is the main reason the dinosaurs went extinct (but thatâ€™s unconfirmed).
- **Reactosaurus** is powered by *fossilized JavaScript*â€”well, almost.

This project will need a BIG cleanup at the end, chao!
